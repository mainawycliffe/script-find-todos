# Find Todos Program

This is a go example of a program that can be used to finds todos inside your
code comment blocks using [Script](https://github.com/bitfield/script) Go library.

> script is a Go library for doing the kind of tasks that shell scripts are good at: reading files, executing subprocesses, counting lines, matching strings, and so on.

## Run this example

Finding todos in a directory:

```shell
go run main.go ./path/to/directory
```

## Roadmap

- Save Results to File
- Use Gitignore to ignore files
- Switch to Cobra for the CLI
- Support JSON/Yaml Output
